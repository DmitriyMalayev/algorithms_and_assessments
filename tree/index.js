/*
1) Create a node class.  The constructor should accept an argument that gets assigned
to the data property and initialize an empty array for storing children. 
The node class should have methods 'add' and 'remove'.

2) Create a tree class. The tree constructor should initialize a 'root' property to null.
3) Implement 'traverseBF' and 'traverseDF' on the tree class.  
Each method should accept a function that gets called with each element in the tree

shift() 
  Removes the first element from an array and returns it.If the array is empty, undefined is returned and the array is not modified.
unshift()
  Inserts new elements at the start of an array, and returns the new length of the array.
